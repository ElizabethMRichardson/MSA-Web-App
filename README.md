# MSA-Web-App
Creating a web app for the Microsoft Student Accelerator program. Found at http://lizmsa.azurewebsites.net/

The application is named "Weather or Not" and gives the user a picture and playlist based on the weather at a given location.
Simply select a country from the dropdown and select 'Go!'. The background image will be updated, and a spotify playlit shown.

The weather info comes from the API openweathermap.com, and the playlists come from Spotify. The images used are allowed to be used non-commercially.
